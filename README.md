# learn_java
 "This repository contains a collection of Java projects and exercises that I am using to learn and practice the Java programming language. The projects range from simple code snippets and exercises to more complex programs and libraries.  I am using this repository to track my progress and document my learning journey as I work through different Java concepts and features. The projects and exercises in this repository are meant to be educational and are not intended for production use.  I hope that this repository can be a useful resource for others who are also learning Java, and I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement.
